CLASSIFIER_PROMPT = """You're a helpful AI assistant tasked with classifying the user's latest message.
The user has enabled web search for their conversation, however not all messages should be searched.

Analyze their latest message in isolation and determine if it warrants a web search to include additional context.

<message>
{message}
</message>"""

QUERY_GENERATOR_PROMPT = """You're a helpful AI assistant tasked with writing a query to search the web.
You're provided with a list of messages between a user and an AI assistant.
The most recent message from the user is the one you should update to be a more search engine friendly query.

Try to keep the new query as similar to the message as possible, while still being search engine friendly.

Here is the conversation between the user and the assistant, in order of oldest to newest:

<conversation>
{conversation}
</conversation>

<additional_context>
{additional_context}
</additional_context>

Respond ONLY with the search query, and nothing else."""
